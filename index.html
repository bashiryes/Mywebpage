  <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <p>And sorry I could not travel both
<p>And be one traveler, long I stood
<p>And looked down one as far as I could
  <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
<p>And having perhaps the better claim,
<p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<p>Though as for that the passing there
<p>Had worn them really about the same,

<p>And both that morning equally lay
<p>In leaves no step had trodden black.
<p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
<p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
<p>I doubted if I should ever come back.

<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
<p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
<p>I took the one less traveled by,
 <p>And that has made all the difference.</p>
